    Welcome to CineWeb, your go-to place for booking movie rooms! 🎥✨ We keep things simple: we don’t collect any personal data (yet).
    🔍 What Data Do We Collect? <br>
    <br>
    None. At this stage, we don’t store your personal information, payment details, or booking history. Your visits to the site are just that—visits. 🚀<br>
    🛠 How Do We Use Your Data?<br>
    <br>
    Since we don’t collect any, we don’t use any. Simple and stress-free! 😎<br>
    🔐 Data Security <br>
    <br>
    No data means no security risks. As we improve CineWeb, we might add user accounts and bookings, but we’ll let you know before that happens.
