# Back-End Course Exercises - Epicode

Welcome to my **Epicode Back-End Development** journey! This repository contains all the exercises and projects I complete throughout the course. Here, I document my learning progress, challenges, and practical implementations as I build expertise in:

- **C# & .NET** - Writing robust, scalable, and maintainable backend applications.
- **ASP.NET** - Developing web applications and RESTful APIs with industry best practices.
- **SQL & Databases** - Managing data efficiently with relational databases.
- **API Development** - Designing and consuming APIs to connect front-end and back-end services.

Each folder includes a detailed description of the project/exercise, the steps I followed to complete it, and well-commented code for clarity.
